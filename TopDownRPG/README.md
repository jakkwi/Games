# TopDownRPG

The game contains:
- Camera Control: Zoom In and Out with Mouse Wheel, Rotation by +/- 45 degree on Q/E buttons, Movement with WASD and Arrows. Added Clamp for boundaries and Interpolation to smooth the movement of camera.
- Debug Menu: Most common Commands usable during playing to help debug things as first Tab. It is made with Widgets: Buttons, Overlay, Border, Vertical/Horizontal Boxes, Editable Text, Expandable Area, Widget Switcher etc. DebugMenu containing a lot of life utility to debug things live - setting grid, changing camera, changing environment, chaning type of grid, diagonal neighbours and so on.
- Grid: Grid depends on environment (trace channel from Z:1000 to Z:0 to catch things that can be tiled), so it's easy to add or remove something on map and the grid will automaticly catch those changes and adapt.
- Grid Type: There are three types of working grid to use: Hexagon (like Civ games), Squares (Like XCOM), and Triangles (don't know the example for this one haha).
