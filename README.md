# Games

A collection of different games I made using UE5. Choose any folder in *Games* to check it out.

Important!
- The assets used in those projects do not belong to me. 
- I am using Git as VCS, Trello as Scrum, and Blueprints in UE5 due to the end of my free Rider subscription while VS2022 has tons of errors.
